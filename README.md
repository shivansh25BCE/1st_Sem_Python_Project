CAFE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This program enables a user to order his favourite items from a list of items.
The interactive UI made with the help of tkinter also helps the user to easily access the program.

The user can:
1. See the menu displayed on the left side
2. Select items to add from the drop down menu
3. Select the amount of items
4. See the bill being made right infront of your eyes
5. Calculate the total amount of money that has to be paid
